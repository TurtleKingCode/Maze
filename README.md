Coding Challenge #3: I'm making a maze
# The Maze
So you have a maze, and you have to get to the goal of the maze
the moving commands are north, south, east, and west
I accept short hand commands to like n, s, e, w
If you want to check your inventory, you type "inventory"
Or you can use the shorthand "I"
