# Maze
Coding Challenge #3: I'm making a maze
# The Maze
So you have a 15x15 maze, and you have to get to the goal of the maze<br/>
The moving commands are `north, south, east, and west`<br/>
I accept short hand commands to like `n, s, e, w`<br/>
If you want to check your inventory, you type `inventory`<br/>
Or you can use the shorthand `i`<br/>
If you want to check how many points you have, you type `points`<br/>
Or you can use the shorthand `p`<br/>
<br/>
You gain points as you move across squares<br/>
The more squares you move across, the more points you get<br/>
Just make sure you don't get lost<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of getting lost, there is a visual map that you get to use to see where you are on the maze
