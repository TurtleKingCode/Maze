# Maze
Coding Challenge #3: I'm making a maze
# The Christmas Maze
So you have a 15x15 maze, and you have to get to the goal of the maze<br/>
The moving commands are `north, south, east, and west`<br/>
I accept short hand commands to like `n, s, e, w`<br/>
If you want to check your inventory, you type `inventory`<br/>
Or you can use the shorthand `i`<br/>
If you want to check how many points you have, you type `points` or `p`<br/>
<br/>
You gain points as you move across squares<br/>
The more squares you move across, the more points you get<br/>
Just make sure you don't get lost<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of getting lost,<br/>
You have a drone that showes you constant footage of your surroundings<br/>
Your drone can only fly so far, and this is the Cheap one<br/>
You need the more Expensive one that you may luckly come across during your walk through the maze<br/>
If you do come across that maze, keep in mind that you can only use it 20 times<br/>
You activate it's abilities with the command `view more` or `vm`<br/>
And it would allow you to see 2 cells to either side of you<br/>
<br/>
Once you've completed the maze<br/>
You would get to seea full birds eye view of the maze you just went through<br/>
And the points you've gained (which essentially is the number of cells you've moved across)<br/>
