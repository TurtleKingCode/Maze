# Maze
Coding Challenge #3: I'm making a maze
# The Maze
So you have a maze, and you have to get to the goal of the maze<br/>
the moving commands are `north, south, east, and west`<br/>
I accept short hand commands to like `n, s, e, w`<br/>
If you want to check your inventory, you type `inventory`<br/>
Or you can use the shorthand `i`<br/>
<br/>
You gain points as you move accross squares<br/>
The more squares you move across, the more points you get<br/>
Just make sure you don't get lost<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of getting lost, theres a visual map that you get to use to see where you are on the maze
