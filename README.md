# Maze
Coding Challenge #3: I'm making a maze
# The Maze
So you have a maze, and you have to get to the goal of the maze<br/>
the moving commands are north, south, east, and west<br/>
I accept short hand commands to like n, s, e, w<br/>
If you want to check your inventory, you type "inventory"<br/>
Or you can use the shorthand "I"<br/>
